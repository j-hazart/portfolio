Lalambic is a web application developed during my web developer training. The goal was to
create an application based on data retrieval from an API. I utilized the API from the
website <span style="color:#F6B352">[TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com)</span>.

This application aims to be an online catalog of cocktail recipes that enables users to
recreate cocktails based on their preferences, utilizing a search system by name, types,
ingredients, with or without alcohol.
